# CoHostCue

An ad-hoc app for a very specific problem: If you co-host an interview-style podcast that's also recorded remotely, it's often helpful to give cues to your co-host. For instance _"I have a follow up question"_, or _"You should jump in next"_. Typing while recording is not ideal due to noise, speed, etc. CoHostCue gives you a few simple buttons for common queues to streamline it. That's it. 

Hitting the root page of the app `/` to create a new "studio" with a random ID. Share that link with your cohost, cue, and be cued!

This code-base is almost entirely AI-written! Only small tweaks and fixes were done by hand.

#### Running

I'm currently deploying this on replit, but you can also run it directly with:

```bash
node index.js
```
